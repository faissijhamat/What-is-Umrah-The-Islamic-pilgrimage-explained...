# What-is-Umrah-The-Islamic-pilgrimage-explained...

Mecca, Islam's oldest and holiest place, is a significant location for Muslims all over the world. It is situated in Saudi Arabia's western Hijaz area.

The Prophet Muhammad is said to have received the Quran, Islam's holy book, at this location.

A pilgrimage to Mecca known as Umrah is a shorter variant of the yearly Hajj pilgrimage. In Arabic, the word "Umrah" implies "visiting a populated area." Umrah provides Muslims with an occasion to renew their faith, seek forgiveness, and pray for their needs.

Muslims can renew their faith, ask for pardon, and pray for their needs during Umrah. It is stated that whoever does it is purified of their sins.

Umrah is elective, but Hajj is required for those who are physically fit and financially able to do so.

Hajj is one of Islam's five pillars, and all Muslims who are capable of performing it must do so at least once in their lives.

Although Umrah can be undertaken at any time of year, Hajj is only performed between the 8th and 13th of Dhul Hijah, the Islamic lunar calendar's penultimate month.

Umrah is a spiritual “quick fix,” and depending on how busy it is, it can be done in under two hours. Hajj is a longer, more intensive experience that takes place over several days.

Hajj is one of the world's largest yearly gatherings of people, with about two million pilgrims from 188 nations participating each year. Several million pilgrims may participate in Umrah, sometimes known as the "smaller" pilgrimage, each year, owing to its lower cost and shorter duration.

Umrah is a religious obligation...

During his lifetime, the Prophet conducted Umrah four times. There is disagreement among the four Sunni schools of thought over whether doing Umrah at least once in one's lifetime is obligatory.

Umrah is not considered Fardh (mandatory) by the Hanafi and Maliki schools of thought, but it is considered a Sunnah Mu'akkadah by the Hanafi and Maliki schools of thinking (emphasized Sunnah). The performance of Umrah, on the other hand, is deemed Fardh by the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of thought, exactly like Hajj.

Tawaf and Sa'i are two important rituals that Muslims must do as part of their Umrah. Tawaf is a circumambulation of the Kaaba. Then there's Sa'i, a trek through in Mecca's between Safa and Marwah to remember Hagar's seek for water for her kid and God's mercy in answering prayers.

Types of Umrah...


There are two types of Umrah:

Umrah al-Mufradah — this sort of Umrah is undertaken separately from Hajj and can be conducted at any time of the year, save on Hajj days.

Umrah al-Tamattu is a sort of Umrah that is conducted in combination with Hajj and is usually undertaken in the month of Dhul Hijjah, just before Hajj begins. This sort of Hajj is called Hajj al-Tamattu, and it is the most usual and straightforward for pilgrims to do.

How can pilgrims travel to Umrah?

Worshippers from outside Saudi Arabia normally travel in and must apply for a special Umrah visa, which is valid for one month. They must also have a hepatitis vaccination and the necessary documentation to prove it.

Visitors from nearby countries may cross the borders by car, but they must also obtain a visa.

There is no need for special documentary evidence for Saudis or those who are already living and working in the country.

Muslims of any age can conduct Umrah and Hajj, and there are no limits to how many times they can make the trip in their lifetime.

Women underneath the age of 45, on the other hand, must be preceded by a mahram, a male family member, or a relative over the age of 17. Women over the age of 45 are allowed to travel with group tours without the need for a mahram.

What are the Umrah rituals?

Put yourself in a state of Ihram (purity and devotion)...
In the miqat station, recite the Talbiyah and declare your niyat to conduct the Umrah.
Get yourself to Mecca.
Enter the Masjid Al Haram and execute the tawaf, which is circling the Kaaba seven times counterclockwise.

Are there any rules during Umrah?

A pilgrim must be in Ihraam, which is derived from the Arabic term harama, which meaning banned.

The results confirmed the concept that pilgrims performing Umrah (and Hajj) must attain a spiritual condition of near-human perfection. There will be no arguing, cursing, or foul language. No animal may be hurt; even the killing of an insect will breach the condition of Ihraam and render Umrah null and void.

Pilgrims are not permitted to cut, shave, or pluck their hair, trim their nails, wear make-up or perfume, or use any other items. According to Islamic law, any of these actions would render Ihraam null and void.


The next stage is to publicly declare their ability to act Umrah. This is normally done when a person reaches the Meeqat (entry points to Mecca marking the start of observing the Ihraam). The pilgrims then give a prayer and must follow the regulations outlined above until the pilgrimage is completed.

What do people wear during Umrah?

Ihraam also regulates what pilgrims must wear. It represents the equality of all humanity before God. It means that no one person is greater than another because of their gender, nationality, or social class.

It is two pieces of unstitched white fabric, one layer that protects half of the body and is wrapped around the waist, and the other wrapped around the upper half of the body and shoulders for men. The Ihraam is worn without any undergarments or other apparel.


Men wear sandals and should keep their heads uncovered.

Women can dress in any simple, long, loose-fitting garment. Many women wear a plain black abaya, which is a long-sleeved flowy dress that covers the entire body, and a simple hijab, or headscarf. The face cannot be hidden.
